Be sure to capture at least a few minutes worth of logs. When sharing these logs, DO NOT attempt to paste them into a channel. Instead use a pastebin service such as [this](https://paste.debian.net/) or [this](https://pastebin.com/).

When done, don't forget to disable logging. This is especially important when running off an SD card, as it will cause unnessecary writes, and might shorten the life of your media."

To get your issue solved, make sure to provide as much information as possible. 

**1. Provide sufficient information**
This includes the following:
* Conbee I/II or Raspbee I/II?
* What platform are you running on? Virtual machine? Docker? Home Assistant Add-on? Official SD card images? Other?
* What hardware are you running on? NAS? RPi? Laptop?
* If using RPi, do you see voltage warnings in sudo dmesg?
* What devices other than Conbee/Raspbee are connected to your server? SSD disks? Other sticks? Any USB3 devices?
* If using a Conbee I/II, are you using an extension cable?
* Do you see any errors in the deCONZ log? Some of the most common error codes is explained here: https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/wiki/Zigbee-Error-Codes-in-the-Log

**2. Enable deCONZ logging**
Open the deCONZ GUI and click Help. After that, click Debug View.  The following debug levels need to be enabled for proper logging: INFO, ERROR,ERROR_L2,APS,APS_L2.

Put the output of these logs in a pastebin and share the link. This will improve your chances of getting help."
