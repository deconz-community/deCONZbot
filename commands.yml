    The best way to pair a new device

    1. Change the setting to search for device in phoscon to 10 minutes
    2. Start the search for lights/sensors/switches
    3. Reset the device
    4. In case of a battery device, keep it awake.
  wiringpi: |
    Updating wiring pi for use with Raspbee on RPI4:
    ```
    cd /tmp wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb
    sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb
    ```
  extensioncable: >
    The extension cable is needed to avoid the USB3.0 interference bug. Any 2.4GHZ device has this issue, but with a USB extension cable you can avoid that.

  indeconznotphoscon: >
    If you see devices within deCONZ but not in Phoscon, that is most of the time perfectly normal. 
    Phoscon is closed source and needs devices to be added manually by their developer. 
    However, the device will still be usable with the API/Home-Assistant/OpenHAB etc.
    You may want to go ahead and request support for your device at the [Forums](https://forum.phoscon.de/c/phoscon/feature-requests/18)

  debuglogs: |
    Option 1: To get debug logs in a GUI installation, open deCONZ and click `Help`. After that, click `Debug View`. The following debug levels need to be enabled for proper logging: `INFO`, `INFO_L2`, `ERROR`, `ERROR_L2`, `APS`, `APS_L2`.  
    Please note that in the HA Addon and Docker webVNC you can't copy paste. You need to use a Native VNC Client. [HA Addon How-To](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/deconz-addon-how-to-enable-vnc-set-port-in-network-configuration/137597), [Docker Environment Vars](https://github.com/deconz-community/deconz-docker#environment-variables). 

    Option 2: To get debug logs in a headless installation / ssh session, use the following commands:
    ```
          sudo systemctl stop deconz-gui
          sudo systemctl stop deconz
          /usr/bin/deCONZ -platform minimal --dbg-aps=2 --dbg-info=2 --dbg-error=2 | tee debug.txt
    ```

    When done, exit the process with `CTRL+C`. You can now start the systemctl service again. Your logs will be printed in the console, as well as saved to a file named `debug.txt` in the current directory. Be sure to capture at least a few minutes worth of logs. When sharing these logs, DO NOT attempt to paste them into a channel. Instead use a pastebin service such as [this](https://paste.debian.net/) or [this](https://pastebin.com/).

    Afterwards, don't forget to disable logging. This is especially important when running off an SD card, as the debug logging will cause unnessecary writes, and might shorten the life of your media.
  iobrokerdebug: To enable logging in ioBroker, Go to `Instances` -> `Activate Expert Mode`  -> `Column Log-level` -> `debug`.
  iasenroll: |
    1. Open deCONZ. 
    2. Select the Coordinator (blue node) on the map and copy value of the IEEE field.
    3. Select the Motionsensor, click the `ias zone` cluster.
    4. Scroll down to the attributes list to attribute `0x0010`
    5. Double click the `value`
    6. Put the IEEE value you copied earlier in the textbox above.
    7. Make sure the Sensor is awake. This can be done by clicking the reset button once.
    8. Click `Write`
  troubleshoot: |
    To increase you chances of getting your issue solved, make sure to provide as much information as possible. 

    **1. Provide sufficient information** 
    This includes the following:
    * Conbee I/II or Raspbee I/II? 
    * What platform are you running on? Virtual machine?
    Docker? Home Assistant Add-on? Official SD card images? Other?
    * What hardware are you running on? NAS? RPi? Laptop?
    * If using RPi, do you see voltage warnings in sudo dmesg?
    * What devices other than Conbee/Raspbee are connected to your server? SSD disks? Other sticks? Any USB3 devices?
    * If using a Conbee I/II, are you using an extension cable?* Do you see any errors in the deCONZ log? Some of the most common error codes is explained here: https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/wiki/Zigbee-Error-Codes-in-the-Log

    **2.Enable deCONZ logging**
    Open the deCONZ GUI and click Help. After that, click Debug View. The following debug levels need to be enabled for proper logging: INFO, ERROR,ERROR_L2,APS,APS_L2. Put the output of these logs in a pastebin and share the link. This will improve your chances of getting help.
  firmwareupdate: >
    The firmware update button doesn't work properly in the HA addon or docker installations.
    Nor does it work fine in Virtual machines. On [this](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/wiki/Update-deCONZ-manually) page you can find out how to update. Please use a native installation to update.
